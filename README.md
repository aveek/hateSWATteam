Use these Python codes to look for who spread hate speech, fake news &amp; misinformation by tweeting &amp; RTing (sharing)

**This program can be used to find who all RTed a tweet,
tweeted on a hashtag # or keyword**

Run on an IDE like VS Code, PyCharm or command prompt/terminal by typing: python3 RTers.py

No programming knowledge or tech knowledge is required. Just enter search terms as instucted in
unhighlighted portions in the code files. Make no changes elsewhere

**
First run tweet_search.py & then people_details.py.**

A guide on how to use the codes and interpret the csv spreadsheet files will be provided in a Youtube tutorial video
tomorrow at 3 PM live on https://www.youtube.com/c/aveeksen

You can get a Twitter API key by applying for a developer account. Easy and quick to get

Also remember to search within 7 days of the tweet(s) being posted. Otherwise they 
cannot be searched for free and requires the Twitter paid premium API
