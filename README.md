Use these Python codes to look for who spread hate speech, fake news &amp; misinformation by tweeting &amp; RTing (sharing)

**No programming knowledge or tech knowledge is required. Just enter search terms as instucted in
unhighlighted portions in the code files. Make no changes elsewhere
**

**This program can be used to find who all RTed a tweet,
tweeted on a hashtag # or keyword**

Run on an IDE like VS Code, PyCharm or command prompt/terminal by typing: python3 tweet_search.py in command prompt (cmd) or terminal

The codes have to be run in order. First
python3 tweet_search.py

and then 

python3 people_details.py



A guide on how to use the codes and interpret the csv spreadsheet files is provided in this Youtube tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8VX3j9hT-8

You can get a Twitter API key by applying for a developer account. Easy and quick to get. Will be needed to run the code

Also remember to search within 7 days of the tweet(s) being posted. Otherwise they 
cannot be searched for free and requires the Twitter paid premium API
